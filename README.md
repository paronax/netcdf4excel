## About
This repo updates the orignal NetCDF4Excel one. Here we aim to use NetCDF v4 with such cool features like advanced compression.  
(some other features lack, like groups, see this update as an opportunity to manage netCDF 4 files like v3 ones). 

## Build
One must already compiled HDF5, HDF5_HL and NETCDF-C libraries.  
Then compile the vbnc.dll

The XLAM can be used as an Excel add-in.  
The DLLs (all of 4) must be placed somewhere in your path.
